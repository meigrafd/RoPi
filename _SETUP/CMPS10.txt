I2C UNO pins: A4 (SDA), A5 (SCL)
I2C Mega2560 pins: 20 (SDA), 21 (SCL)


 needed: 2x 1k8 or 4k7 resistors between:
  Arduino pin A4 and 5V -> CMPS10 SCL
  Arduino pin A5 and 5V -> CMPS10 SDA

To enter the I2C mode of operation leave the mode pin unconnected
To enter the serial mode of operation connect the mode pin to ground
To enter the PWM mode of operation connect the select PWM pin to ground
